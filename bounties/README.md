# Welcome to IPFS Bounties!

## Definition
Bounties are simply _incentives for closing (fixing) issues_. Issues with bounties attached to them are listed in [BOUNTIES.md](BOUNTIES.md). When the original issue is closed by a PR, the author of that PR is considered eligible for the bounty.

## How to Propose
To propose a bounty [open a Pull Request against BOUNTIES.md](BOUNTIES.md) and add the issue to the table. Issues tagged ["help wanted"](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/labels/help%20wanted) often make good bounty subjects.

Once the bounty is accepted, it's a good idea to add a comment to the issue linking back here.

NOTE: it is the responsibility of the bounty issuer to disburse the award.

## How to Collect
Open a Pull Request with your work fulfilling the bounty issue (don't forget to include ["fixes #..."](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords) in your PR so it automatically closes the issue). Once the PR is approved and merged, simply open a [Bounty Claim](https://github.com/protocol/ipfs-grants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bounty-claim.md&title=Bounty+Claim%3A+%3CWhat+You+Fixed%3E) issue in this repo to collect your reward!
