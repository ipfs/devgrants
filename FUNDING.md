# Funding Organizations

## About
This page lists the major funding organizations backing [RFPs](rfps) and [Open Grants](open-grants). Being listed here is not required to fund grants, but having invoicing and any policy information readily available can help applicants navigate the grant writing process more smoothly. 

If your organization intends to back multiple grants in the IPFS ecosystem, please PR this file with appropriate info.
