Draft of IPFS Grant Platform repository (private, to be moved to ipfs org upon shipping)

## Grant Types

### Bounty
The bounty challenges are simply issues in IPFS-related repos that have a monetary reward associated with them. You don't need to propose a solution or spec out the work for these challenges⁠—simply submit a patch addressing the issue and you can claim the bounty once the PR is merged.

For a list of issues eligible for Bounties, award amounts, and more details see [BOUNTIES](bounties). Bounties are generally funded by the maintainer of the code.

### RFP
Projects too large for a bounty are specified as RFPs and can range from more complex feature work on IPFS to entirely new tools and libraries. 

To see open RFPs and learn more about the proposal process see [RFPs](rfps). RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.

### Open Grants
Do you have an idea for pushing the IPFS ecosystem forward not already covered by an RFP? 

To read more about creating an Open Grant proposal, see [OPEN GRANTS](open-grants).

### Adoption Micogrant
These are small grants intended to help stimulate experimentation with and adoption of IPFS across a wide range of fields. The application and reporting requirements are more relaxed, but the monetary awards are smaller as well (max $1k).

To read more about Adoption Microgrants see [MICROGRANTS](microgrants). Adoption Microgrants are funded by Protocol Labs.
