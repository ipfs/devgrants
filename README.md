| 📣 As of May 2021, several grant types have re-opened to applications. |
|---|

Welcome to the IPFS Grant Platform! The IPFS Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the IPFS community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on IPFS tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

### Bounty
Bounties are monetary awards for completing eligible issues in IPFS-related repos. To claim a bounty, simply submit a patch addressing the issue &mdash; no other proposal or pre-approval is required. Once the PR is merged, you can claim the bounty. You can also offer a bounty by following the steps in [Bounties: How to Propose](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-propose).

[**LIST OF BOUNTIES**](../../projects/1) • [**CLAIM A BOUNTY**](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-collect) • [**START A BOUNTY**](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-propose) • [Read More](BOUNTIES.md)

### Next Step Microgrants
Grants of $5,000 in FIL are available to support taking the _next step_ after you have created an initial prototype with IPFS. These grants are intended for independent developers, small studios, non-profits, activists, and researchers. Applicants may be working independently, or as part of a course or hackathon. The microgrants are intended for early stage projects.  If your project has already received more than $30,000 USD from any source, please apply to for an open grant (details below) rather than a microgrant.

Acceptance criteria are very simple, and work is expected to be complete within 2 months. Adoption Microgrants are funded by Protocol Labs.

### Open Grant
Do you have an idea for pushing the IPFS ecosystem forward? Grants of up to $30,000 are available to support for novel ideas that advance the IPFS ecosystem, bring significant new usage, or directly advance the IPFS mission statemnent.

### Targeted Grant
These are grants negotiated directly with a recipient, rather than going through the usual RFP/open grant process. Targeted Grants are currently made by Protocol Labs.

[**See In-Progress Targeted Grants**](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atype%3Atargeted-grant) • [**See Completed Targeted Grants**](targeted-grants/completed)

### RFP

|⚠️ on hold ⚠️|
|---|

Projects too large for a bounty are specified as RFPs and can range from more complex feature work on IPFS to entirely new tools and libraries. 

To see open RFPs and learn more about the proposal process see [RFPs](rfps). RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.
