## IPFS Devgrants — Archived

This repository has been archived. Thank you to all the developers who built new tooling and apps through this programme — your contributions have been invaluable to the IPFS ecosystem.

---

As part of [the new governance structure][governance-post] for the protocol, grants for IPFS are now focused on integrations, extensions, and new implementations that make IPFS accessible across a variety of languages, platforms, and systems — rather than individual apps. From time to time, targeted RFPs will be posted on the [IPFS Implementations Grants website][ipfs-grants].

In the meantime, share your ideas on the [IPFS forum][ipfs-discourse], [Discord][ipfs-discord] or [Matrix][ipfs-matrix].
