## Approval Process
### PR Acceptance
The first stage of approving an open grant is merging it into the repo. The goal of the review process is ensuring that the proposal is well formulated, serves the needs of the IPFS community, and meets the grant program [TERMS](../TERMS.md). Accepting the PR means that the proposal is well-formed and ready to be funded, but it does **not** mean that funding is allocated.

### Funding
Accepted grant PRs are available for funding by the community.
