# Welcome to IPFS Bounties!

## Definition
Bounties are simply _incentives for closing (fixing) issues_. Issues with bounties attached to them are listed on the [Bounties project board](../../projects/1). When the original issue is closed by a PR, the author of that PR is considered eligible for the bounty.

Bounties are a good fit for simpler tasks like fixing minor bugs, adding test cases, updating or translating documentation, or building small, well-specified features. Projects with good test coverage and automated CI make it much easier for bounty hunters to do their job.

If your task is larger in scope, ambiguous in specification, or requires a lot of rebasing, it may be better to specify it as an [RFP](../rfps). 

Issues tagged ["help wanted"](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/labels/help%20wanted) often make good bounty subjects.


## How to Propose
To propose a bounty simply tag your issue in the "Open Bounties" column on the [Bounties project board](../../projects/1) with the award amount. It's also a good idea to add a comment to the issue linking back to this document so your contributors can learn how to claim the bounty.

NOTE: it is the responsibility of the bounty issuer to disburse the award.

## How to Collect
Open a Pull Request with your work fulfilling the bounty issue (don't forget to include ["fixes #..."](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords) in your PR so it automatically closes the issue). Once the PR is approved and merged, simply open a [Bounty Claim](https://github.com/protocol/ipfs-grants/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bounty-claim.md&title=Bounty+Claim%3A+%3CWhat+You+Fixed%3E) issue in this repo to collect your reward!
