# RFP

## About
RFPs (Requests For Proposals) are detailed descriptions of a technical problem seeking proposed solutions, the best of which will be funded for execution. This could be a protocol level improvement, a novel algorithm, a developer- or user-facing tool, and so on (linked examples TK).

A successful RFP grant requires a detailed problem statement with well-defined acceptance criteria and budget, as well as a Proposal describing the implementation plan and clear deliverables.

If you're interested in a smaller grant with simpler application and reporting requirements, take a look at the [microgrants](../MICROGRANTS.md).

If you have a detailed proposal for a project that will broadly benefit the IPFS community that doesn't answer a particular RFP, you may want to try an [open grant proposal](../open-grants).

## How To Propose
### Intended Audience
You're a developer or development team that can complete the work described in an RFP within the budget and up to spec.

### Propose

## How To Create RFP
### Intended Audience
You're an organization looking to solicit technical contributions for a well-defined project. You have the necessary technical or product expertise to specify the work, evaluate proposals, and determine the correctness of the result.

### Create
To create an RFP, open a PR based on the [RFP template](https://github.com/protocol/grants/new/master/rfps/new?filename=rfp-%3CYOUR%20TITLE%20HERE%3E.md&value=%23What%20is%20the%20NAME%20of%20your%20project...TK) (don't forget to change the file name).

Remember: writing a high quality RFP is a lot of work. It's your responsibility to offer detailed instructions and acceptance criteria to the applicants, review proposals in a timely manner, and evaluate the finished work.

### How To Help Fund an RFP
### Intended Audience
You're interested in accelerating the development of a specific feature, or perhaps broadly supporting IPFS work as a foundation or private donor.
