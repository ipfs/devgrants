To create an RFP, open a PR based on the [RFP template](https://github.com/protocol/grants/new/master/rfps/new?filename=rfp-<YOUR TITLE HERE>.md&value=%23 What is the NAME of your project...TK) (don't forget to change the file name).

Remember: writing a high quality RFP is a lot of work. It's your responsibility to offer detailed instructions and acceptance criteria to the applicants, review proposals in a timely manner, and evaluate the finished work.
